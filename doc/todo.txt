    Sequence is important if "changing" a value
    What's wrong with 'gradle.properties'.
       File name is fixed.
       Since you can have only one in home directory and one in project
        directory, it's impossible to separate shared from private properties

        -, :, or any white space character.  Suggest that $ works well.
    The two *Delim settings are mutually exclusive.
