    x(Long[,]ArrayList)=3.14,6.28

Allow specifying targets other than the Project, like Extension objects.

    Escaping
    Multiple definitions for a single property are useless.
    Equivalent references in a single properties file are stable.  I.e., in a
     single properties file ${x} will always resolve to the exact same thing.
    Intuitive sequence.
        If the reference of a ${ref} is assigned to in "this" file, then the
        very last assignment in this file is honored.
    Changing variables ok now
    Can only reference String variables, whether typecasting or not.
