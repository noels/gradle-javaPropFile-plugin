overwrite + overwriteThrow.  Check for incompatible combo.
typeCasting
    First look for a .valueOf(String) method
    Lacking that, look for a (String) constructor
Allow ^([^)]) or ([^)])$ where () only usable with value of 'null'.
systemPropPrefix (Gradle uses 'systemProp.')
    System.properties['file.separator'] = '@'

Document
    Note that app.properties for shared, etc.
    Sequence is important if "changing" a value
    What's wrong with 'gradle.properties'.
       File name is fixed.
       Since you can have only one in home directory and one in project
        directory, it's impossible to separate shared from private properties
        in an intuitive way.
    If use typePrefixDelim or typeSuffixDelim, if you use any of
        -, :, or any white space character.  Suggest that $ works well.
    The two *Delim settings are mutually exclusive.


A future release
    Allow specifying targets other than the Project, like Extension objects.
