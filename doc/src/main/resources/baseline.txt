This is just here to prove that, due to file name matching in 'build.gradle',
this file is not filtered at all.

The "baseline.txt" file(s) under build/... should have the exact same contents
"as src/main/resources/baseline.txt".

These ${...} references should not get expaneded: ${name} ${sys|username}.
