Important information for users upgrading JavaPropFile
    
GOTCHAS

    * Version 0.4.* and later require Gradle 1.0-milestone-6 or later.
      (This is due to compatibility-killing Groovy upgrade in Gradle).
    * If you upgrade gradle to milestone-6, completely wipe out your Gradle
      cache at $HOME/.gradle.  Nasty, confusing problems may result if you do
      not.  This has nothing to do with JavaPropFile, but with Gradle caching.


Recent functional changes.

    Version 4.x introduces two new major features, 'keyAssignPrefix'es, and
    loading of Maps (in addition to Projects and extension objects).  Both
    are implemented by new load method signatures, so see the main "README.txt"
    file, sub-section DETAILS / Provided Public Methods.

    Excepting the items listed below, recent changes are all backwards
    compatible, and the many unit tests assure this.

    ! To allow for the new 'keyAssignPrefix', the method signature to
      do a load into an extension object has changed from

        propFileLoader.load(File, String)

      to

        propFileLoader.loadIntoExtensionObject(File, String)

      Calling "propFileLoader.load(File, String)" will load the file to the
      Gradle Properties object with the specified keyAssignPrefix.

      BehaviorRefPrefixes, as described in "README.TXT", are fully implemented
      in the source code repository, and will be in the next public release.
