JavaPropFile is a Gradle Plugin with which you can...

    Load properties files into Gradle Projects, Extension objects, other
    Gradle objects.  Many object types supported.

    Expand ${references} in Strings, text files, property values, recursively.
    Variables to be referenced may be Gradle properties, extension objects,
    other objects, user-supplied map, and all types.  Works with most object
    types, using toString().
